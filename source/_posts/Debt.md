## Part One

In 1875, a major debate erupted within the Qing government's upper echelons over whether to protect Xinjiang as a part of the nation. To many today, it might seem inconceivable to question the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a region as vast as Xinjiang. However, young people often fail to fully comprehend the question of "where does the money come from" until they experience financial hardships. When there are many things they wish to do, but a lack of funds leads to frustration and unrealized ambitions, they gradually come to understand the importance of financial resources. Similarly, nations face the challenge of protecting their territories during difficult times, often resulting in the loss of significant land.

During that time, China faced threats from Japan in the east and Russian encroachment in the northwest. It was not a matter of choosing which side to protect but rather a question of where to find the funds. The Qing Dynasty had just concluded the Taiping Rebellion, and the prosperous Jiangnan region had been laid to waste. The aftermath of the sacking of Nanjing had not been fully cleaned up. The primary concern for the Qing government was not which region to protect but how to raise the necessary funds.

In the end, General Zuo Zongtang proposed borrowing money from Western banking consortiums and using that money to purchase American weaponry. At the time, the United States had just concluded the Civil War, resulting in a surplus of weapons waiting to be sold at discounted prices. As history has shown, the Qing government approved this plan, and Zuo Zongtang led his forces through the Yumen Pass, using borrowed funds to contain Russian expansion in Xinjiang.

Zuo Zongtang's troops were the first Chinese "modernized" forces, equipped with American breech-loading rifles and German Krupp artillery, which overwhelmed the Russian-equipped forces of Agui Bugu. This marked the rapid pacification of Xinjiang under Zuo Zongtang's leadership. This event is possibly one of the most significant "national debt events" in modern Chinese history.

There is, however, a lesser-known consequence of this event. At that time, British banks agreed to lend funds to the Qing Dynasty, but they required collateral, much like securing a mortgage loan today. To secure a loan from a bank, one must demonstrate the ability to repay. What collateral did Zuo Zongtang offer? It was the customs revenue of the Qing Dynasty. After borrowing money, the Qing Dynasty's customs revenue went directly into the hands of the British, much like paying a monthly mortgage.

This put Li Hongzhang in a difficult position, as he could no longer secure loans to expand the fleet. The Qing Dynasty's customs revenue could only support Zuo Zongtang's loan, leaving no room for further loans to Li Hongzhang. As a result, the Beiyang Fleet, eight years after its completion, saw no increase in warships for seven years, and the main warships went without repair for seven years. Eventually, in the First Sino-Japanese War, they were defeated by the Japanese, who had modern warships. The northeast was on the brink of being partitioned between Japan and Russia.

Through international mediation, Shenyang was saved, but a significant portion of the territory fell into Russian hands, and later, more territories were gradually lost. I know many are eager to mention the "Empress Dowager diverting navy funds for garden construction" issue. This is a complex matter, and I can elaborate on it in more detail if there is interest. However, modern naval expenses have always been exorbitant, and the funds used for the Empress Dowager's garden did not have a significant impact.

Furthermore, national defense is a comprehensive undertaking. The Qing Dynasty was truly defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War mainly due to land battles. The Japanese modern army easily overwhelmed the Qing Dynasty's land forces, captured coastal forts, and used them to sink the Qing Dynasty's navy. The threat to Beijing forced the Qing Dynasty to sign a humiliating treaty.

In hindsight, without that national debt event, Xinjiang might not exist today. Of course, Agui Bugu's strength in Xinjiang was far inferior to Japan, and even if those loans had been given to Li Hongzhang, the outcome of the First Sino-Japanese War might have been similar.

Later, the Beiyang government borrowed funds again, providing the funds for the recovery of Outer Mongolia. However, they were unable to retain it as Russia was no longer in control, and the Soviet Union, intent on securing the Trans-Siberian Railway, insisted on detaching Outer Mongolia. China's capabilities at the time could not hold on to Outer Mongolia.

China did not begin practicing "national debt" or advanced financial operations until the late 19th century, while Europe had been heavily engaged in such practices since the 16th century.

When the Bank of England was established in 1694, the practice of governments borrowing money from individuals was institutionalized. This was the inception of the world's first central bank, the Bank of England, and its primary purpose was to facilitate government borrowing through the issuance of national debt.

When the state needed to fund wars or disaster relief and had already allocated most of its tax revenue, it often found itself short of funds. In such cases, the government would issue a promissory note to the Bank of England, promising to repay both principal and interest from future tax revenue within five years. The bank would provide the funds to the government, and the specifics of how the bank acquired the money were of no concern to the government.

The bank would then break down the government's promissory note into numerous bonds and sell them to individuals looking to invest and earn returns. Wealthy individuals, businesspeople, and even criminal organizations from around the world could purchase these "investment products" from the Bank of England. Initially, there was some apprehension among buyers about the government defaulting on its loans, similar to how certain "high-yield" investment products were viewed in recent years. However, it became apparent that the government never defaulted; it always repaid its debts on time, which eventually instilled confidence in investors. Consequently, the interest rates on British national debt were kept low, making it easier for the British government to borrow.

These government bonds were like banknotes, indistinguishable from one another, and anyone holding them could redeem them for the principal and interest in five years. These bonds could also be sold to others at a discount, thus creating a secondary market for government debt. Their high liquidity made them more appealing to investors, propelling the British government's financing capabilities to a new level.

It was this pioneering and resourceful method that allowed Britain to emerge victorious in the War of the Grand Alliance, the Seven Years' War, the Napoleonic Wars, and the Crimean War.

The United States adopted this model, largely preserving its original form. As history has demonstrated, government borrowing played a pivotal role in the American Civil War, World War II, and the Cold War. This approach allowed the United States to win these critical conflicts.

Which government can issue low-interest national debt often determines its likelihood of eventual victory in the struggles between nations. However, if a government consistently issues a large amount of debt relative to its capacity to repay, it may lead to disaster.

The United States embraced this system, which paved the way for its modern industrial revolution, and it reached new heights. In 1816, Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter to Samuel Kercheval that he wanted to see "a system by which every fiber would be eradicated of antipathy against other, and our present situation be literally a state of peace, and as to every circumstance of internal government which I have been able to look forward to, it is as it was."

The cornerstone of this "system" was the establishment of a federal bank, which facilitated both government borrowing and the issuance of a common currency. The government bonds, which were initially held by a few wealthy individuals, were traded among the public through the federal bank's central clearing house. The federal bank could issue a uniform currency for the entire country, greatly simplifying trade, and the resulting economic integration led to higher productivity and economic growth.

The United States gradually rose to become the world's most powerful nation. By 1881, U.S. economic growth had outstripped that of the world's leading economic power, the United Kingdom. On July 18, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln established the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an independent bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, with the sole authority to charter national banks. This office oversaw the currency and established the national banking system. It laid the groundwork for the United States to develop into a global superpower over the next 150 years.

The national banking system was the basis for the currency's unification and laid the foundation for the country's rise to superpower status. Meanwhile, national banks provided funding to the government for large infrastructure projects, such as the transcontinental railroad and the construction of the Panama Canal.

In his presidential inaugural address, Abraham Lincoln declared, "The legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do, for themselves in their separate and individual capacities." This simple philosophy was put into practice with the establishment of the national banking system.

## Part Four

With this background, let's return to the story of China. Throughout history, China had never embraced the practice of government borrowing. The reason was that it was not seen as "respectable." In traditional Chinese culture, the occupation of scholars, farmers, industry, and commerce were highly regarded, while finances were typically associated with "usury" and were not well-received. For the purpose of providing stability, the Qing Dynasty levied heavy taxes on its citizens.

As Qing China entered the modern era and needed to borrow money, it began by borrowing money from individuals, such as wealthy merchants and bankers. The Qing government made use of silver from Potosí (in present-day Bolivia) to purchase American silver. In addition, the Qing Dynasty required copper to print more currency, and copper was sold to Japan in exchange for silver, which was used to repay its debts.

China's currency was therefore very different from that of Europe. Europe had a unified currency system and a central clearing house. In contrast, China's currency consisted of privately issued banknotes, and transactions were carried out using cash coins. When foreign exchange was required, it was necessary to convert it into silver before conducting transactions.

By the late Qing Dynasty, the government began issuing its own currency, marking the start of China's national debt. China's fiscal policy was established under these new circumstances. The Qing government continued to issue currency notes and sell them, effectively borrowing money from the public. However, these were essentially promissory notes that could be exchanged for silver at any time. The government was still concerned with defaults on these promissory notes. But compared to Europe, the Chinese did not face insurmountable difficulties in borrowing money. As the government worked to make good on its debts, the public gradually gained confidence in these currency notes.

This marked the beginning of China's transition to modern financial practices. This was the starting point for China's exploration of international practices in government borrowing, which later led to the "national debt event" that we discussed earlier. To a certain extent, the development of Chinese national debt resembled that of Europe and the United States. Over time, with the establishment of the Bank of China, the Qing Dynasty followed a path similar to that of Western countries, working to consolidate its currency and unite it under a common system.

These actions laid the foundation for the development of modern finance in China, as well as its later industrial and economic development. To fully understand the topic of government debt, we must grasp the historical context and the unique characteristics of various nations' experiences.

In conclusion, the role of government debt in economic development cannot be understated. Whether used to finance wars, infrastructure projects, or other essential investments, government debt has been a crucial tool for nations to secure the necessary funds for their development. Understanding the historical evolution of government debt in different regions provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between fiscal policy and economic growth.
