description: SpaceX's second test flight of Starship, although still a failure, sparked heated discussions among netizens and was described by some as a successful explosion. During this test flight, Starship solved some of the problems of the first test flight, such as the reduced damage to the launch pad, the normal ignition of the engine, and the successful separation of the thruster and rocket. The speed of evolution of Starship has made people look forward to Musk's Mars colonization plan even more.

Last weekend, just as everyone was busy eating OpenAI's melons, SpaceX's Starship ushered in its second test flight.

Starship is currently the world's largest launch vehicle, with a diameter of 9 meters and an overall height of 120 meters, which is equivalent to a 30 to 40-story building, and the size of a person in front of it is almost negligible:

Many people's memories of Starship may still be stuck in the failed launch in the first half of the year.

Starship made its first test flight at SpaceX's launch base in Boca Chica, Texas, on April 20 this year, when the rocket lost its attitude and began to spin 2 minutes and 30 seconds after liftoff, and finally disintegrated and exploded.

At that time, the launch pad also blew up a huge crater.

To be precise, the 120-meter starship is composed of 70-meter thrusters and a 50-meter rocket body, which is responsible for sending the rocket to a certain height in the air, then separating from the rocket, and then sending the rocket into a predetermined orbit by the rocket's own engines (6 Raptor engines).

But the biggest problem with the failure of the first test flight was that the Starship failed to successfully separate the rocket and thrusters during the liftoff.

And of the 33 Raptor engines equipped at the bottom of the thrusters (engines developed by SpaceX specifically for Starship), three failed to ignite, two failed halfway, and one was good and bad.

This almost became a meme at the time, and even memes like this can be seen on Chinese social media:

like the first test flight, the second test flight of the Starship failed.

Before the launch, SpaceX boss Elon Musk has been promoting Starship again on the social platform X for several days (during which he also posted a lot of updates about commenting on current events and explaining X's development issues, etc.).

The launch date was originally scheduled for Nov. 17, but was postponed by a day due to the need to replace the grille fin actuators.

At 7 a.m. local time on November 18, still at the same location, Starship was launched for the second time and was broadcast live on social platform X.

Musk and his younger brother Kimbar Musk watched the whole process of the Starship launch together at the scene.

Judging from the live broadcast footage, until 3 minutes and 22 seconds ago, it was still in normal lift-off, and even successfully completed the separation of the rocket and thruster; But at this moment, the thruster suddenly exploded in the air, and the picture was a little shocking.

The rocket also lost signal after continuing to ascend for a short time, and SpaceX confirmed a few minutes later that the spacecraft had self-destructed in the air (triggering the self-destruct system because it did not enter the intended orbit).

If you just look at the results, the second test flight of the starship was indeed a failure, no different from the first; But it was such a failed launch, which aroused heated discussions among netizens at home and abroad, and there were not a few people who expressed their admiration, and even gave people the illusion that it had been successfully launched.

Space photographer John Kraus, for example, described it as an "incredible launch":

Even NASA Administrator Bill Nelson sent a congratulatory message to SpaceX congratulating Starship on the progress it made in its second test flight:

Musk himself was even more excited, and expressed his congratulations to the SpaceX team as soon as possible, and later forwarded several beautiful photos of the Starship taken by SpaceX one after another:

He also happily reposted the main points of the Starship's test flight summarized by netizens with Grok (the first artificial intelligence model launched by Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI):

Then people from different places began to share their own views of the starship, especially this video taken from Tamaulipas, Mexico, which borders the launch base, which is the best view:

As one netizen summed it up, this is actually "a failed launch, and a successful explosion".

At least in comparison, the second test flight solved many of the problems of the first test flight, and several major aspects can be summarized as follows:

> **1\. The damage to the launch pad has been reduced**
> 
> **2\. All 33 Raptor engines mounted on the thrusters are working smoothly**
> 
> **3\. The thruster and rocket can be separated smoothly.**

The first is the launch pad. Because the entire Starship program was designed to reuse rockets and various surface infrastructures, it was necessary to find a way to make the launch pad more robust.

SpaceX's approach was, on the one hand, to reinforce the launch pad with concrete.

On the other hand, a water cooling system has been added to the launch pad, which Musk described as a "giant inverted shower head", using the method of spraying water upwards to boost a large amount of heat generated by the booster (this year's version 3.0 of the Raptor engine has upgraded its thrust, making the total thrust of the booster as high as 8877 tons, and the heat generated is also greater).

Then there are the engines on the thrusters. The engines of the thrusters of this test flight were all ignited normally (except for the premature shutdown of several engines when the thrusters and rockets were separated).

Musk posted a video on X to see the Raptor engine at the bottom of the thruster up close:

SpaceX's explanation for the engine failure during the first test flight was that a fuel leak from the booster during the ascent caused a fire, causing most of the engines to lose communication with the main flight computer, causing the equipment to lose control.

Therefore, SpaceX has also added more protection to the booster components this time, including the expansion of the fire extinguishing system.

Finally and more importantly, the separation of thruster and rocket.

The general rocket separation is to separate the rocket from the thruster through explosives or pushers, which means that the rocket will rise by inertia for a while after separation, and the rocket will be ignited with its own engine after a certain distance.

But because Starships have heavier payloads, the usual method of rocket separation may not work.

SpaceX experimented with the "thermal separation" method for the first time in its second test flight, in which the rocket began to ignite while the thruster and rocket were still connected, pushing itself away from the booster.

Musk has described thermal separation as likely to be the "most dangerous part" of the second test flight, as the huge heat generated by the rocket's ignition when connected is likely to cause the booster to explode.

SpaceX then experimented with adding vents and heat shields between Starship's thrusters and the rocket body to vent superheated exhaust gases.

It turns out that thermal separation is suitable for starships. According to Musk, thermal separation creates a small but significant thrust that can increase the payload by about 10%. This also means that Starship has reached the doorstep of entering orbit.

In the more than half a year since the first flight, SpaceX has solved all the key problems of Starship, and the results have been immediate.

According to the concept of the Starship program to reuse rockets and infrastructure, the most important thing for SpaceX in the next step should be to solve the problem of recovering rockets and thrusters (ideally the rocket body should be recovered at the launch site, and the test flight is temporarily set to fall on both in the Gulf of Mexico for recovery).

Judging from the above points, the results of the second test flight of Starship show that the progress is still quite large.

On the other hand, the Starship project itself was not designed from the beginning to be a rocket to be finalized at one time:

SpaceX's original vision was to use a series of prototype tests to gradually improve the starship and eventually reach its design goals.

It's a lot like the idea of an Internet product iteration, and according to SpaceX's vision, there could be as many as dozens of "test machines" for Starship testing, and most of them will be destroyed in various tests.

This is also unprecedented in rocket development, and it is no wonder that every time there is a new test of Starship, netizens @more_space will sacrifice the following picture:

Judging from the current evolution rate of Starship, Musk seems to be getting closer and closer to his Mars colonization plan, and he may blow up a few billions of dollars of high-altitude fireworks, which can really blow up the future of mankind.
