On the eve of the Fed's interest rate decision, the market has really begun to accept the statement that "higher interest rates will remain for longer".

Overnight, U.S. Treasury yields continued their recent upward trend, with the 10-year yield hitting its highest record since 2007 and the 2-year yield approaching its highest in more than a decade.

DXY, a basket of dollar indexes against six major currencies, briefly fell below the 105 mark, but ended up 0.07%, marking the ninth straight week of gains for the index and the longest consecutive upward trend in nearly a decade.

At the very short end of the yield curve, expectations of interest rate changes during the year have declined modestly, while expectations of interest rate changes over the next year have also fallen, with the market pricing in stable interest rates over rate cuts.

In addition, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool, the probability of the Fed leaving interest rates unchanged at the remaining three monetary policy meetings of the year rose to 99.0%, 70.8% and 59.8%, respectively. Investors also expect a 50.1% chance that the Fed will cut rates next 6, down from more than 80% a month ago.

## Evidence of "longer-term high interest rates"

Some analysts saw clues from last week's inflation data that the Fed will keep interest rates high for longer.

The headline US CPI rose 3.7% year-on-year in August as oil prices rebounded sharply, the second consecutive month of rebound, and the month-on-month increase was the largest in 14 months.

When volatile energy and food categories are excluded, the core CPI rose 0.3% in August, accelerating for the first time in six months and faster than economists forecast of 0.2%.

Julie Biel, portfolio manager and senior research analyst at investment management firm Kayne Anderson Rudnick, said:

> This supports the view that interest rates will remain high for longer because inflation remains fairly high in some areas.

In addition, a series of recent US economic data have been more resilient, delaying the date of the market's expected interest rate cut.

For example, the ISM non-manufacturing industry in the United States exceeded expectations in August, reaching a six-month high of 54.5 that exceeded expectations, and the number of non-farm payrolls in the United States increased by 187,000 in August, exceeding expectations.

Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay, previously said: "The US economy continues to challenge widespread skepticism, with persistent upside surprises driving yields higher."

It is worth mentioning that the workers' strike movement in the United States is in full swing, igniting market fears of recession and rising inflation.

Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson expects that if members of Detroit's "Big Three" UAW launch a full-blown strike, U.S. quarterly GDP could take a 1.7 percentage point hit.

Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett believes that the 2020s was an era of inflation and rising interest rates, with worker strikes as one of the three main reasons, and unions have become the core driver of inflation. High US deficits and geopolitics will also put upward pressure on interest rates and inflation.

However, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the overall U.S. economy showed no signs of an imminent recession and remained in a "healthy" state, with industrial output rising and inflation falling.

Yellen also said it was too early to tell the impact of the auto industry strike on the economy, which would largely depend on how long the strike lasted and who was affected.

In addition, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, despite his tough stance at the Jackson Hole Global Central Bank Annual Meeting, did not say anything surprising - the Fed will continue to rely on data while waiting for inflation to fall back to 2%.

##  Can "longer-term high interest rates" replace interest rate hikes?

The answer is not black and white.

In theory, central banks could provide some degree of restraint by setting interest rates at extremely restrictive levels for a shorter period of time, or more moderately restrictive levels over a longer period of time.

Maintaining a smoother path is preferable to sharply raising and lowering interest rates because it gives policymakers more time to evaluate economic data.

But reality is often influenced by more and more complex factors, such as damage to central bank credibility and greater stickiness in inflation, so the promise of restraint tomorrow and no longer high interest rates for a long time is not a complete substitute for acting today.

The analysis expects the Fed to pause rate hikes in September and continue to present options in a harsh and resolute tone to create space for a gradual transition to a pause in rate hikes. Only when inflation and the labor market rebalance and economic growth is stronger than expected will the central bank consider the option of raising interest rates again.

## Tech stocks are falling off the altar again?

A prolonged period of elevated interest rates may support the dollar, but it is not so good for technology stocks, especially those with higher valuations.

Late last week, the information technology industry's P/E ratio was 25.5 times the expected P/E ratio for the next 12 months, up from 20 times at the end of last year and above the 10-year average of 18.5, according to FactSet.

Among them, the biggest winner of technology stocks this year, Nvidia, has an expected P/E ratio of 31.7 times, in addition, Microsoft and Apple have an expected P/E ratio of 29.9 times and 26.9 times, respectively.

Big tech stocks in consumer discretionary look even more expensive. Amazon trades at 50.1 times earnings and Tesla at 63.8 times earnings.

You know, over the years, investor enthusiasm for tech stocks has been driven not only by innovation by software and hardware companies, but also by ultra-low interest rates that make the future profits promised by these companies particularly valuable. Therefore, investors are willing to exchange higher prices for future earnings.

The rules of the game reversed last year when the Fed began raising interest rates sharply to curb inflation. By the end of 2022, the S&P 500's tech sector had fallen 29%, becoming cheaper relative to earnings, and was below the S&P 500 for the first time since 2013.

John Davi, CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Astoria Portfolio Advisors, said:

>There's a new playbook for a world of higher real interest rates and higher inflation, and just because something has worked in the last 10 years doesn't mean it will work for years to come.
