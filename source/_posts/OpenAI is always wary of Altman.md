Sam Altman returns in style.

On the evening of Tuesday 21st local time, OpenAI released heavy news on its social media platforms: Altman returned to OpenAI to resume his role as CEO, and the board of directors was changed in a big way.

The new board is now made up of three people: Bret Taylor, who has served as an executive at Facebook, Twitter, and Salesforce, as chairman; Larry Summers, a U.S. economist and former Secretary of the Treasury; and Adam DeAngelo, founder of Quora. DAngelo), the only remaining member of the old board.

Altman stayed on as CEO but did not return to the board. Greg Brockman, the former chairman of OpenAI, who was kicked off the old board on Friday, also confirmed his return to OpenAI in a post on the X platform, but only said he was "back to coding". But he only said "back to coding", not "back to the board".

So, with the exception of DeAngelo, all of the old board members are now out, and the new board consists of three outside directors, with no internal OpenAI directors.

Until Friday, OpenAI's original board consisted of six people, three internal and three external. On Friday, the old board launched a "surprise attack", suddenly kicked Altman and Brockman out of the board and removed Altman as CEO, leaving OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist IIya Sutskever with one internal director and three external directors.

In the days since, the story has reversed itself, with Altman reclaiming his position as CEO and returning to OpenAI with Brockman after a period of employee turmoil, investor pressure, negotiations and breakdowns, Altman and Brockman joining Microsoft, and 90% of the workforce signing a joint letter to "force the hand of the board".

In the letter, the employees gave the board two choices: either Altman and Brockman come back and the board is replaced, or the 700 or so of us leave and follow Altman to Microsoft.

Obviously, the result of the new round of confrontation is that the employees "forced" the success of the board of directors of the new member of the Brett Taylor is still one of the nominated candidates.

Altman and Brockman celebrated by posting on X. Altman said, "All I've done in the last few days is align this team and its mission. When I decided to join Microsoft on Sunday night, it was clear that this was the best path for me and the team." Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also sent his best wishes.

At this point in the story, it seems that the "infighting" within Silicon Valley's star company that caused such a stir has come to an end with Altman's landslide victory.

But is it really over? It is not difficult to find, **new directors are all ruthless, and ousted Altman's company "big bug", has not been fixed**. The question is, is the bug really a bug? Artificial Intelligence is clearly going to have a major impact on the human race in the future, so is it really right to remove the sword hanging over the heads of those in power with AI like Altmann?

## One.

OpenAI's new board of directors currently consists of only three people, but each is a tough cookie.

**Newly promoted director Bret Taylor, an old friend of OpenAI**, in a joint letter employees demanded that OpenAI's old board of directors be replaced, and suggested two people to be the new director, Taylor is one of them. After the full text of the joint letter was released by the media, there is news that Taylor does not intend to join the OpenAI board of directors, if the news is true, then Taylor now serves as chairman of the board of directors behind the insistence of all parties and lobbying.

Taylor is also a technical background, with a bachelor's and master's degree in computer science from Stanford University, worked for Google, Google Maps research and development on his contribution. He has held several executive positions in technology companies. He was the chief technology officer of Facebook and co-CEO of cloud software giant Salesforce.

Big changes at the top of tech companies, something Taylor has experience with. Taylor was chairman of Twitter (now renamed X) when Elon Musk was going to buy it last year. When Musk backtracked on the acquisition, Taylor stepped up to the plate and threatened to sue Musk. In the end, Musk didn't screw over Twitter's board of directors and bought the company for a whopping $44 billion, as promised, and dissolved the board afterwards.

**Larry Summers, on the other hand, is the most heavyweight of the three directors**. 

Summers, who is in his 70s, is "highly respected" and has an impressive resume. Summers became one of the youngest tenured professors in the history of Harvard at the age of 29, served as president of Harvard University, is a famous economist. Clinton period, he served as U.S. Treasury Secretary; Obama period, he was in charge of the U.S. National Economic Council, is the chief architect of U.S. economic policy. It can be said that Summers led the United States nearly two decades of economic policymaking.

The former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury known for his outspokenness, has repeatedly criticised the "Biden economics". In addition, he has predicted that under the impact of artificial intelligence, the U.S. "could see nearly one-third of adult males out of work by the end of the second half of this century".

Prior to OpenAI, Summers served as a director of a number of companies, including US mobile payments company Square and B&B platform Airbnb.

**Another director, Adam D'Angelo, has become the biggest "conspicuous bag" on OpenAI's new board**. He's the only remaining member of the old board, and just before Altman's return was announced, the media was on a "mole hunt," and D'Angelo got a lot of coverage as "mole number one.

D'Angelo is Mark Zuckerberg (Mark Zuckerberg) high school classmates, served as Facebook's first CTO, but also by the "Fortune" magazine as "one of the smartest people in the technology industry", and later founded the U.S. version of the Quora. Jello and Altman previously had a major disagreement, not long ago OpenAI released GPTs, and D'Angelo dissatisfied with Altman did not communicate with the board of directors of this decision. Moreover, Poe, the AI browser project incubated by Quora, was already in competition with OpenAI. The report also said that DeAngelo is stubborn, almost never be persuaded by others, in Quora has a history of abruptly firing executives.

Considered a "mole" but the only survivor of the old board, DeAngelo's retention may be a counterweight to the "conservative" side of the negotiation, and the joint letter's demand for the resignation of the entire old board has not actually been fully met, Altman said. There are still impurities in this huge victory back at OpenAI.

## Two

It should be noted that the "mole" claim is not yet fully credible. The question of how the "surprise attack" took place last Friday remains an open one, a game of "Wolfsbane" in the making.

Before D'Angelo's claim that he was the mastermind behind the attack, the outside world identified Sutcliffe as the driving force behind the incident - as OpenAI's co-founder and CTO, and one of the three internal directors, Sutcliffe was the "head of the party" who notified Altman and Brockman to attend the dismissal meeting. Sutcliffe was the "front man" who notified Altmann and Brockmann of the recall meeting, and it was discovered that he disagreed with Altmann on AI security issues.

In the wake of D'Angelo's claim that he was behind this, another old board member, Helen Toner, was also "outed" because she had previously published a paper that the media reported Altman was unhappy with, arguing that it criticised OpenAI's efforts to secure AI technology, and even tried to get Toner kicked off the board. Toner off the board.

In addition, after the first round of negotiations between OpenAI's old board of directors and Altman broke down last Sunday, former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear, who was appointed as the new interim CEO, said that although he had accepted the invitation, he would investigate the incident and generate a report on the "strange attack". However, as of this writing, no results of the investigation have been released.

Some of the descriptions in the joint letter from OpenAI employees also shed light on the confusion surrounding the "surprise attack" incident, stating that after Altman was fired, OpenAI executives tried to co-operate with the board of directors, but the board has not been able to provide specific facts about Altman's "concealment", nor has the board of directors been able to provide information about Altman's "concealment". The letter said that OpenAI executives had tried to co-operate with the board after Altmann's dismissal, but that the board had been unable to provide specific facts about Altmann's "cover-up" or produce any evidence.

Although there is no conclusive answer, the very fact that the case is "unsolved" reveals at least two problems: the "surprise attack" itself may have been initiated in a very short period of time from the discussion to the lack of "detailed preparation" and "investigation". In just a few days, Sutcliffe, D'Angelo, and Toner were dug out of their differences with Altman, showing that there had been cracks within OpenAI for a long time.

Although Altman returned victorious, but the biggest problem has not been solved: ** how to avoid this kind of thing happening again? Or rather, how to solve the systemic problems at the source of this "surprise attack"? **

This incident fully exposed Altman's lack of control over OpenAI (perhaps in the hearts and minds of the people, but as the CEO of the company, he was very passive).

OpenAI was founded as a non-profit and later formed as a limited for-profit company due to existential difficulties. The for-profit entity, OpenAI LP, was responsible for financing the company to solve the problem of high R&D costs, and Microsoft came in with $1 billion, and has now invested tens of billions of dollars in OpenAI.

The OpenAI LP, a for-profit entity, still has some distinctive limitations, as investors can't earn more than 100 times their investment. And when a conflict arises between an OpenAI for-profit company and a non-profit organisation and a vote is needed to make a decision, only board members who don't hold shares in OpenAI LP have the right to vote.

Altman doesn't directly own shares in OpenAI itself, but because he was chairman of YC Combinator, which invested in OpenAI LP and thus has no voting rights. This is very different from the practice of most companies, generally speaking, the CEO holds a large number of shares of the company, the company enjoys a high degree of voting rights.

Prior to the "surprise attack," only three of the six members of the board of directors were internal directors who were deeply involved in the day-to-day work of OpenAI, and Altman did not yet have a vote. The three outside directors, plus Sutcliffe, an inside director, were enough to kick Altmann and Brockmann out in a heartbeat.

OpenAI's special structure allows for the formation of a "separation of powers" within the organisation, with the CEO holding executive power, the employees demonstrating the power of public opinion in this case, and the six directors constituting OpenAI's "Supreme Court". In the US "separation of powers" system, justices are appointed from the top down and hold the "gavel of justice".

The fact that Altmann and Brockmann were kicked out in the first place was the result of a trial conducted by the "judges". Such a trial is obviously not in line with the public opinion of OpenAI, and even more against the interests of the majority shareholders and the will of the founders, so it is impossible to understand this kind of behaviour by purely business logic. However, if we consider AI as a kind of power, and this kind of power is obviously becoming more and more important, then if we look at this incident from the perspective of separation of powers and checks and balances, and understand that the foundation of the U.S. Constitution is precisely this kind of vigilance and wariness of unchecked power, it is not impossible to understand why OpenAI has to devise a system that does not seem to be very trustworthy to its managers and investors.

Now bottom-up and outside forces have come together to replace the justices. But Altman won't be done with it once and for all: the new judges, in theory, could still do the same thing. This is the result of a deep-seated belief: **He who holds power must have a sword hanging over his head**.

There were efforts on all sides to bring Altman and Brockman back to OpenAI. Not only did OpenAI's employees rise up and issue a joint letter requesting "go to the board of directors and keep Altman", but outside investors, including Microsoft, are also working hard to bring about this outcome. Microsoft has even been reported to have offered $10 million each in signing incentives to OpenAI employees willing to follow Altman to Microsoft.

That imaginary "next time" may not be very likely in terms of probability, but it will certainly hover over Altman's head - next time, will it be so "lucky"?
